      <p class="text-muted text-left" >There are separate boarding houses for boys and girls having bed strength of 200. Each house is placed under the supervision of a Housemaster / Housemistress. There is a matron in residence for each house to care for the well being of the students. Modern, tiled both Indian and western bathrooms are within the dormitories.
The School has dispensed with the double decker beds and has provided the students with individual beds, spacious cupboards, study tables, with drawers and bookshelves. This helps create the necessary environment so very essential for a healthy teaching – learning experience. Each dorm has been provided with a common room and recreation area which provide the students the opportunity of relaxing and entertaining themselves after a hard day’s work.</p>
